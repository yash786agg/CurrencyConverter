# CurrencyConverter

The application contains a list of the various currency rate conversion against top most base currency which is continuously updating the rates at every second of interval.
User can change the base currency after clicking on any of the items in a list and it will be automatically shifted to the topmost position in the list and will become the
base currency against the other currency values.
